central board of direct taxes income tax direct taxes tax policy matter suggestions pan no dear sir i would like to express my concerns regarding the new tax regime for fy as per the governments announcement individuals with taxable income up to lakh are exempt from paying income tax many of my colleagues fall under this category and will not be required to pay any tax on their income up to lakh which i wholeheartedly welcome however my taxable income for fy is lakh which means that due to a mere difference of in income i am being taxed on the entire lakh essentially i am being forced to pay tax on lakh which is exempt for my colleagues in the same income range this seems unfair to me and i would like to highlight that it feels unjust that only the small difference in income makes such a significant impact on my tax liability the government has made it clear that income up to lakh is tax exempt so it would seem logical and just to only levy tax on the amount above lakh this approach would be more rational and fair especially considering the relatively small difference in income moreover with the vast resources available to the government both directly and indirectly through various taxes i feel it is unnecessary to impose such taxation on individuals when a simple adjustment could make the system fairer it seems contradictory that people earning just more than the exempted threshold are being burdened with tax on the entire income including the portion that is otherwise exempt in conclusion i believe the government should reassess this approach and consider exempting taxes for all individuals earning up to lakh applying the tax only on the income exceeding this threshold this would promote fairness and rationality within the tax system and foster a more positive sentiment among taxpayers thank you for considering my concerns sincerely md miraz

dear central govt please help me to understand how tn rera can help the common man first they rush to book a hearing then the advocate is very expensive i have tried at least so far and all are too much then on top of that the buyer is expected to pay for structural tests and other tests to prove the case when the builder showed negligence to such a degree and has crores and crores at their disposal and there is no way to know whether rera will rule for builder to compensate legal and other costs so how does rera help common people also when i finally reached the main office of tn rera after many messages saying the number was not in service they couldnt even tell me their email address correctly luckily i recognized what she meant and she finally agreed to assign a new date based on these issues i am facing in finding an affordable advocate but how does it help if they again rush to assign one in mid march based on what the advocates i have asked have told me so far i would need till at least may to prepare correctly and that too having the hearing date shared in febmarch not in april or may itself as was done here with the hearing booked in a rush on feb but only informed at end of jan people need more time when taking on a negligent builder who knows what hurdles a buyer faces to bring about justice

urgent issue with pcc portal repeated rejections amp payment concerns dear twitter the pcc police clearance certificate portal is causing significant inconvenience to applicants due to lack of form validation missing modification options and repeated payments for rejected applications the process is fundamentally flawed and unfair to the public key issues faced form rejections without proper reasons my pcc applications were unjustly rejected twice due to an quotincomplete addressquot issue however my aadhaar card and electricity bill have the same address which was previously accepted for pcc approval i even attached last years approved pcc for verification yet my application was rejected again no modification option in portal if an application is rejected there is no way to edit or modify it instead applicants are forced to reapply and repay even for minor issues repeated payments without resolution i have already paid twice but have not received a valid pcc the system should allow corrections instead of forcing repeated payments verification process not transparent police verification should be conducted properly at the station or at the applicants home however in many cases verification is not conducted properly and applications are rejected without any clear solution request for resolution allow modifications to rejected applications instead of forcing users to repay each time ensure a transparent verification process to avoid unnecessary rejections provide a grievance redressal mechanism on the pcc portal to address such issues the pcc application fee in other states such as uttar pradesh is only why is the fee on the pcc portal so high why should applicants suffer due to a flawed system this issue contradicts the principles of digitalindia and must be resolved immediately

corporate affairs others i am writing to you as a student of the icsi to express my concerns regarding the provisions of the new income tax bill concerning tax audit eligibility the bill as it currently stands restricts the conduct of tax audits to quotaccountantsquot a term that appears to be defined exclusively as chartered accountants this effectively excludes company secretaries cs and cost and management accountants cma from performing tax audits while i understand the importance of ensuring the competence and integrity of those conducting tax audits i believe the current provision overlooks the expertise and training that cs students and members possess during our icsi studies and mandatory internships before obtaining the membership certificate we receive comprehensive training in taxation accounting auditing and related financial subjectsthis rigorous curriculum equips us with the necessary skills and knowledge it is concerning that despite our demonstrated capabilities the bill does not recognize cs professionals as eligible to conduct tax audits this exclusion seems particularly unjustified given that cs professionals are also regulated by a professional body and adhere to a strict code of conduct this is not an isolated instance similar discrepancies exist in other legislations such as the securities laws and company law where exclusive rights should be granted to us as well if this is done then in the future students will not want to pursue cs or cmas or any other professional degrees as all rights are given to ca and we are not being treated equally i firmly believe that all professionals including cas css and cmas bring unique and valuable expertise to the table and should be given equal opportunities to contribute within their respective domains i respectfully request that you reconsider the provisions of the income tax bill and make the necessary amendments to include company secretaries as eligible professionals to conduct tax audits
