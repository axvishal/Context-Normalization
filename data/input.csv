central board of direct taxes income tax direct taxes tax policy matter suggestions pan no dear sir i would like to express my concerns regarding the new tax regime for fy as per the governments announcement individuals with taxable income up to lakh are exempt from paying income tax many of my colleagues fall under this category and will not be required to pay any tax on their income up to lakh which i wholeheartedly welcome however my taxable income for fy is lakh which means that due to a mere difference of in income i am being taxed on the entire lakh essentially i am being forced to pay tax on lakh which is exempt for my colleagues in the same income range this seems unfair to me and i would like to highlight that it feels unjust that only the small difference in income makes such a significant impact on my tax liability the government has made it clear that income up to lakh is tax exempt so it would seem logical and just to only levy tax on the amount above lakh this approach would be more rational and fair especially considering the relatively small difference in income moreover with the vast resources available to the government both directly and indirectly through various taxes i feel it is unnecessary to impose such taxation on individuals when a simple adjustment could make the system fairer it seems contradictory that people earning just more than the exempted threshold are being burdened with tax on the entire income including the portion that is otherwise exempt in conclusion i believe the government should reassess this approach and consider exempting taxes for all individuals earning up to lakh applying the tax only on the income exceeding this threshold this would promote fairness and rationality within the tax system and foster a more positive sentiment among taxpayers thank you for considering my concerns sincerely md miraz
